 ### Introduction
 
I wanted to analyze the SUICIDE data collected from all over the world (1985-2016 year).Death by suicide is an extremely complex issues that causes pain to hundreds of thousands of people every year around the world. The main objective of this data entry is to contribute to an informed, open debate about the how suicide rate affects the economy. The project aims to find and explain some relationship between suicide rate and gender, age group/generation, GDP, HDI across countries. I cleaned, analyzed and presented it in the form of a dashboard for it to be more understandable for users and to get more meaningful insights.
